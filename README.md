:hourglass_flowing_sand: Horarium
========
A very skeer :mega: Zermelo schedule viewer made specifically for people using a phone running Android

#### Archival
Sadly, every schedule app dies when the time is due. The maintainer either graduates or the school imposes a rule against smartphone use in school.
In this case, the latter applies. The former should apply sooner than later.

#### Code
If you're on GitHub staring at this repo, considering looking at the [GitLab version](https://gitlab.com/rutgerbrf/horarium) where all the real stuff gets done.

#### Main motivation
The default Zermelo app is very ugly. I don't like it. I think humans (and teachers?) have the right to look at a nice app which (mainly) functions correctly.

#### Summary
A timetable app which is less ugly than the default Zermelo app and which could grow with your effort :+1:

#### Issues
If you'd like to report an issue, please do so on the GitLab instance of the repo (if you can't find the link, don't try filing an issue)

#### VCS
The git-flow workflow is used for proper and easy management. Most of the development will happen on the development branch.
